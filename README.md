ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, I am ARTLee0 or Artem Lepestov, a novice developer and programmer in the Python language.
Education: Graduated from Ryazan Radio Engineering University.
Additional education: Took advanced training courses as a student. He studied programming languages such as Pascal, Delphi and basic with kubacik (as in other things and all students of that time).
Work experience: Worked in many places, starting from a salesman, ending with a screenwriter and a little bit of a director. I tried myself in writing commercials, but something didn't go well. However, delphi created a "GO" game, simple for 200 lines, but in general I lost it - which means it won't work to confirm and play with you ðŸ˜‰
